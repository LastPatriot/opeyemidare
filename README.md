## üöÄ Setup and Usage

This CV is a single HTML file, making it incredibly easy to set up and deploy.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```
    (Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of this repository and `<repository_name>` with the desired local folder name.)

2.  **Open the file:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

    ```bash
    open index.html
    # Or navigate to the file in your file explorer and double-click it.
    ```

3.  **Deployment (Optional but Recommended):**
    For wider accessibility, you can host this HTML file on a static site hosting service like:
    * [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
    * [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
    * [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
    * Any web server

    These services make it easy to deploy your static site and provide a public URL.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note on Credly Badges Display

The Credly badges are embedded using their official JavaScript embed code. For security reasons, **interactive preview environments (like some online code editors or sandboxes) often block the execution of external JavaScript**.

Therefore, while the code for the badges is correctly implemented:
* The badges **will likely not display** if you are viewing the `index.html` file in a restricted preview environment.
* The badges **will display correctly** when the HTML file is hosted on a live web server (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or your own domain), as these environments allow external scripts to run.
